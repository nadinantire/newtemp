														<p>It is indeed a pleasure to present the third edition of the book Essentials of Orthopaedics and Applied Physiotherapy. Bringing out a new edition provides an opportunity to update the book in accordance with the recent advances in the subject. This is exactly what has been done with this edition of the book. Most of the chapters have been revamped with addition of new/better photographs and tables for better understanding. This edition contains 39 chapters, against the 26 in the second edition. The bigger chapters have been split into multiple chapters, organized region wise in body, with a view to update the chapters and easy accessibility to a topic. The project of writing this book was conceptualized with the intention of providing knowledge about orthopaedic conditions and procedures to the physiotherapy students, practising physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons alike. The book was also meant to discuss the physiotherapy protocols after an orthopaedic procedure or treatment. To take this intention further, selected physiotherapy procedures/manoeuvres are being provided along with this edition of the book.  </p>
